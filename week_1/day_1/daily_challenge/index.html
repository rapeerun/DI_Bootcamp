                THOR ODINSON
            </h2>

            Thor is the son of Odin, the All-Father and king of Asgard.<br> He was worshiped by the humans known
            as
            Vikings and became part of Norse Mythology.<br> Armed with his enchanted Uru hammer Mjolnir,
            which helps him to channel his godly energies,.<br> he became the mightiest warrior in the Ten Realms.<br>
            When his irresponsible and impetuous behavior became too much,.<br> Odin sent him to Midgard
            (more commonly known as Earth) as a disabled mortal medical student named Donald Blake,.<br>
            stripped of his memory. After learning humility he regained his memory as well as his godly powers.<br>
            Thor went on to become a champion for Midgard as well as one of the founding members of the Avengers,
            "Earth's Mightiest Heroes".<br>
